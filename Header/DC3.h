 /* This implementation adopts the custom that the input string is an array of
 * integers representing the relative ranks of the characters in the original
 * string. It's assumed that the original string was suffixed by a special
 * sentinel character $ that appears nowhere else in the string. For example,
 * if the true string to build a suffix array for is ABRACADABRA, we'd begin by
 * suffixing a $ terminator to get ABRACADABRA$, then replace each character
 * with its rank ($ = 0, A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, R = 5) to get 125131412510
 * as our input.
